# generative-metagames
This repo contains collaborative research exploring iterative metagames where instances of gamestate are represented as MAIDs but players turns involve evolving the game via "game mining" moves. Since each state in the statespace is actually a game, we are experimenting with "second order" GDS, implementable by making cadCAD configurations states of cadCAD models.
